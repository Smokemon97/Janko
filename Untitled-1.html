        <h3>How this shit started</h3>
            <p> One day i met this oily motherfucker in the gym when he was trying to coach one of his two clients. 
            <br> The issue was that he knows shit about lifting so he was just standing next to him and pretetending
            <br> hes something more than 
            <abbr title="cowshit">CWS</abbr>.
            </p>

        <h3>Why i like him</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Despite hes such a dutchbag hes helping me my whole life
        <li>Constantly pulling me out of shits
        <li>When Janko is near no chalmidia attacks
        </ul>
